Emulator for https://mapache64.ucsbieee.org/

Depends on libraylib.so from https://github.com/raysan5/raylib and libvrEmu6502.so from https://github.com/visrealm/vrEmu6502

Compile with ```make```

Runs with memory dump "rom file" as argument, by default looks for mapache64.bin if run from ```make run```

Must be run with font.png in the same directory
