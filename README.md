Emulator for https://mapache64.ucsbieee.org/

Depends on headers and shared libs from raylib (https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) and vrEmu6502 (https://github.com/visrealm/vrEmu6502)

Compile with ```make```

Runs with memory dump "rom file" as argument, by default looks for mapache64.bin if run from ```make run```

Must be run with font.png in the same directory
